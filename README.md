Before running the app on your own device a few steps and procedures must be taken, as well as the understanding of what files are located where.

        1. The Assets Folder Contains all Assets(Images) needed for the app
        2. The views are responsible for the representation of the UI in the app
        3. Firebase packages are needed to run the app as they represent the backend used.
        4. The Course and Post data files represent Identifiable types refering to the type of which the firebase database uses to configure.
        5. Notifications can only happen on real devices not simulations.
        6. To run the project in Xcode simply add all of these files to one folder and open it.

First make sure you attach backend database to Xcode by copying your bundle ID and attaching it to Firebase.

Then you can stream the app to multiple devices.

Once in the app you can check for the commented code line by line.
